angular-modal-demo
==================

A custom modal directive for AngularJS.

This is fairly vanilla Angular usage. I'm not using any Grunt or Sass, just using Bower for package management.

The main focus of this demo is to attempt to show a *more Angular* way of doing things, implementing some of the recommended practices for better declarative coding and better performance in the Angular framework.

See this [blog post](http://wmyers.github.io/Trying-to-be-angular-with-a-modal/) for more info.
